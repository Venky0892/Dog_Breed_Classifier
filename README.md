# Capstone Project Dog_Breed_Classifier

# Motivation
The aim of the project is to build a dog breed classifier using convolution neural networks. In this project i have a build a CNN using some of the pretained models available out there. The model would be able to identify dog breeds and as well detects a dog breed resembling some a input human images are given.

# Requirements:
1. Tensorflow
2. keras
3. Pretained models 
4. Pandas
5. Numpy
6. Glob
7. Matplotlib

# File Discriptions
1. dog_app.ipynb files contain all the necessary code section to run and train a model
2. All Images folder contains all the images 
3. Model weights for different pretained models
