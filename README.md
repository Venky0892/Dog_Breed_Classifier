# Capstone Project Dog_Breed_Classifier

# Project Overview
Welcome to the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) project in the Data Scientist Nanodegree! In this project, you will learn how to build a pipeline that can be used within a web or mobile app to process real-world, user-supplied images. Given an image of a dog, your algorithm will identify an estimate of the dogâ€™s breed. If supplied an image of a human, the code will identify the resembling dog breed.

Along with exploring state-of-the-art CNN models for classification and localization, you will make important design decisions about the user experience for your app. Our goal is that by completing this project, you understand the challenges involved in piecing together a series of models designed to perform various tasks in a data processing pipeline. Each model has its strengths and weaknesses, and engineering a real-world application often involves solving many problems without a perfect answer. Your imperfect solution will nonetheless create a fun user experience!

# Motivation
The aim of the project is to build a dog breed classifier using convolution neural networks. In this project i have a build a CNN using some of the pretained models available out there. The model would be able to identify dog breeds and as well detects a dog breed resembling some a input human images are given.
The entire pipeline for the model and its technical details are can be found in blog post : https://venkateshprasath-manoharan.medium.com/dog-breed-identification-using-pertained-neural-networks-e7b1e972e539
